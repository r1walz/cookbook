# Cookbook

A repository containing cookbook to our most used algorithms.

## How to use this repository?

Since the work is distributed use the [MIT License](LICENSE), you can freely copy and modify the code contained. Find the algorithm that you want to use in the directory given below and get coding!

## Directory

The repository follows a simple structure, add your work under the relevant directory with the name `<algorithm>[_<optimization_level>].cpp`.

Prepend `t` or `s` to indicate type of optimization done (here time/space respectively).

For example, let's say we want to add 0-1 knapsack then we may add it under `dynamic_programming/0_1_knapsack.cpp`, when no optimizations were done. Or `dynamic_programming/0_1_knapsack_s1.cpp`, where `_s1` indicated some sort of `space` optimizations.

Yes, we avoid spaces in naming! Use `_`s, please.
