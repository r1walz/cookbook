 * Binary Exponentiation is used to find 
 * x raised to power y modulo p in O(log y) time.
 *
 * Raising a to the power of n is expressed naively as multiplication by a 
 * done nâˆ’1 times: a^n = a * a * ... * a. However, this approach is not 
 * practical for large a or n.
 *
 * Now a^(b + c) = (a^b) * (a^c) and a^(2b) = (a^b)^2.
 *
 * The idea of binary exponentiation is, that we split the work using the 
 * binary representation of the exponent.
